                                        <p class="font-light firt-latter">The Fourteenth Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso (July 6, 1935 – present) is the head of state and spiritual leader of Tibet. He was born on 6 July 1935 in a Ye Oman family living in the Takster region of north-eastern Tibet. At the age of two, the boy Lhamo Dhondup was identified as an incarnation of Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is a Mongolian title meaning Ocean of Knowledge and the descendants of the Dalai Lama are believed to be the embodiment of the Buddha's qualities of compassion, Avalokiteshvara.

                                        <p class="font-light">Following China's invasion of Tibet in 1949, His Holiness the Dalai Lama was asked to assume full political power. In 1954, he also went to Beijing to hold talks with many Chinese leaders like Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping. But he was eventually forced into exile in 1959 after the Tibetan national movement was brutally crushed by Chinese forces in Lhasa. Since then he has been living in the northern Indian city of Dharamsala, which is the headquarters of the Central Tibetan Administration. Following China's attack on Tibet, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has appealed to the United Nations to resolve the Tibet issue. Three resolutions have been passed by the United Nations General Assembly in this regard in 1959, 1961 and 1965.

                                        <p class="font-light">In 1963, His Holiness the Dalai Lama presented a draft of a democratic constitution for Tibet. His Holiness then made several improvements to it. However, it was not until May 1990 that the fundamental reforms introduced by the Dalai Lama could be given real shape in the form of a truly democratic government. Tibetan Cabinet to be appointed by His Holiness so far this year; Kashag and the Tenth Parliament were dissolved and new elections were held. The members of the Eleventh Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile were elected on the basis of one person one vote of Tibetans living in India and 33 countries of the world. The Central Tibetan Parliament in Exile in Dharamsala has a total of 46 members, including the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker.

                                        <p class="font-light">In 1992, His Holiness the Dalai Lama announced that the first goal after Tibet became independent would be to set up an interim government whose first priority would be a Constituent Assembly to draft and adopt a democratic constitution for Tibet. To choose The Tibetan people will then elect their own government and His Holiness the Dalai Lama will hand over all political power to the newly elected Interim President. In 2001, on the advice of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile amended the Tibetan constitution and made provision for the direct election of the acting head of Tibet. The elected executive head nominates his cabinet colleagues and their appointments are approved by Parliament. The first directly elected executive chief took office in September 2001.

                                        <p class="font-light">In 1987 His Holiness presented a five-point peace plan as the first step towards finding a peaceful solution to the deteriorating situation in Tibet. He held the view that Tibet could be turned into a sanctuary—a peace zone in the heart of Asia where all sentient beings could live in peace and where the environment was protected. But China failed to respond positively to the various peace proposals put forth by His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

                                        A serious dialogue should be started regarding the future status of Tibet and the relations between the Tibetan and Chinese people.

                                            My religion is simple, my religion is kindness.
                                            We should protect our environment in the same way as we protect our horses. We humans are born from nature, so there is no reason for us to go against nature, that's why I say that environment is not a matter of religion, ethics or morality. All these are such luxuries without which we can survive but if we go against nature then we cannot survive.
                                            <br>
                                            As a refugee, we Tibetans always feel grateful to the people of India, not only because India has helped and sheltered this generation of Tibetans, but also because Tibetans have brought light and wisdom to this country for generations. Got wisdom. That's why we are always grateful to India. If seen from the cultural point of view, we are the followers of Indian culture.
                                            <br>
                                            We are not against Chinese people or Chinese leaders, after all they are also our brothers and sisters as human beings. If they had the freedom to take their own decisions, they would not have engaged themselves in such destructive activities or done any work that would have brought them a bad name. I feel compassion for them.
