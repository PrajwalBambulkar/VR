                                        untouchable and due to this he was deeply socially and economically.
                                        Discrimination had to be tolerated. Bhimrao Ambedkar's forefathers had long

                                        Due to his caste, the boy Bhima was facing social resistance. Despite being able

                                        untouchability. On November 7, 1900, Ramji Sakpal enrolled his son Bhimrao as

                                        province kept their surname from the name of the village, hence Ambedkar's
                                        surname from Ambedkar's Ambedwe village was registered in the school. Later,

                                        surname. From then till today he is known by the name Ambedkar.

                                        also launched a satyagraha for the untouchable community in Mahad city to get
                                        the right to draw water from the city's Chavdar reservoir. At a conference
                                        in late 1927, Ambedkar, in order to ideologically justify caste discrimination
                                        and "untouchability", publicly condemned the ancient Hindu text, the Manusmriti,
                                        many verses of which openly support racial discrimination and casteism, and
                                        he formally burned copies of the ancient text. On 25 December 1927, he
                                        Thousands of followers led the burning of copies of Manusmriti. In

                                        determination to see the Lord for the first time. When they reached the gate,
                                        the gate was closed by the Brahmin officials.

                                        Gandhi, Malviya and other people were included.
                                        Till now Bhimrao Ambedkar had become the biggest untouchable political
                                        personality till date. He bitterly criticized the perceived apathy of the
                                        mainstream political parties towards the eradication of the caste system.
                                        Ambedkar also criticized the Indian National Congress and its leader Mahatma
                                        Gandhi, accusing them of presenting the untouchable community as an object of
                                        pity. Ambedkar was also dissatisfied with the failures of the British rule, he
                                        advocated a separate political identity for the untouchable community, in which
                                        both the Congress and the British would have no interference. On August 8, 1930,
                                        during an oppressed class conference i.e. First Round Table Conference in
                                        London, Ambedkar presented his political vision to the world, according to which
                                        the security of the oppressed class lies in its independence from both the
                                        government and the Congress.

                                        We have to make our own way and ourselves... Political power cannot solve the
                                        problems of the oppressed, their salvation lies in getting their rightful place
                                        in the society. They must change their bad way of living... They must be
                                        educated... A great necessity is to shake off their sense of inferiority and to
                                        instill in them that divine discontent which is the source of all heights.

                                        Ambedkar criticized the Congress and the Salt Satyagraha run by Gandhi. Due to
                                        his increasing popularity and public support in the untouchable community, he
                                        was invited to participate in the second Round Table Conference to be held in
                                        London in 1931. There he had a heated debate with Gandhi on the issue of giving
                                        separate electorates to the untouchables, and the British agreed with Dr.
                                        Ambedkar's views. Gandhi, a staunch opponent of separate electorates based on
                                        religion and caste, feared that separate electorates given to untouchables would
                                        divide Hindu society. Gandhi felt that the upper castes should be given a period
                                        of a few years for their change of heart to forget untouchability.

                                        <br>
                                        In 1932, when the British, agreeing with Ambedkar's views, announced separate
                                        electorates to the untouchables. The announcement of the Communal Award was the
                                        result of the discussions held in the Round Table Conference. Under this accord,
                                        considering the demand for political representation raised by Ambedkar, the
                                        Dalits were given the right of two votes in separate electorates. Under this,
                                        the Dalits could choose their representative with one vote and there was freedom
                                        to choose the representative of the general class with the second vote. Thus the
                                        Dalit representative was to be elected by the votes of Dalits only. With this
                                        provision, there was no interference of the general class in choosing the Dalit
                                        representative. But at the same time, the Dalit class could play its role by
                                        using its second vote to elect the representative of the general class. In such
                                        a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the
                                        problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try
                                        to solve their problems.

                                        Gandhi was at this time in Yerwada Jail in Poona. As soon as the Communal Award
                                        was announced, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister demanding that
                                        it be changed. But when he felt that no action was being taken on his demand, he
                                        announced to fast unto death. Then Ambedkar said that "It would have been better
                                        if Gandhi had kept this fast for the independence of the country, but he has
                                        kept this fast against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable. While Indian
                                        Christians, Muslims and Sikhs got the same K There was no objection from Gandhi
                                        regarding the right." He also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person. Don't
                                        know how many such people took birth in India and left. Ambedkar said that he
                                        could not sacrifice the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life. Now Gandhi's
                                        health was continuously deteriorating due to death fast. There was a huge crisis
                                        on Gandhi's life. And the entire Hindu society became opposed to Ambedkar.

                                        Seeing the growing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada Jail on 24
                                        September 1932 at 5 pm. Here there was an agreement between Gandhi and Ambedkar,
                                        which later came to be known as the Poona Pact. In this agreement, Ambedkar
                                        announced to give up the right of separate electorate given to the Dalits in the
                                        Communal Award. But along with this, instead of the 78 reserved seats received
                                        from the Communal Award, the number of reserved seats was increased to 148 in
                                        the Poona Pact. Along with this, fixed a sufficient amount in education grant in
                                        each province for untouchable people and ensured the recruitment of Dalit class
                                        people from government jobs without any discrimination and in this way Ambedkar
                                        saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi. Ambedkar was unsatisfied with the compromise,
                                        calling Gandhi's fast a ploy by Gandhi to deprive the untouchables of their
                                        political rights and force them to back down from their demands. Ambedkar
                                        condemned this agreement in 1942, expressed his displeasure regarding the Poona
                                        Pact in his book 'State of Minority'. The Republican Party of India has also
                                        held dhikr meetings many times before this.

                                        positions in the political field till 1956. In December 1926, the Governor of
                                        Bombay nominated him as a member of the Bombay Legislative Council; He took his
                                        duties seriously, and often gave speeches on economic matters. He was a member
                                        of the Bombay Legislative Council till 1936.

                                        On 13 October 1935, Ambedkar was appointed Principal of the Government Law
                                        College, a position he held for two years. He also served as the President of
                                        the Governing Body of Delhi University's Ramjas College after the death of its
                                        founder Shri Rai Kedarnath. Ambedkar settled in Bombay (now Mumbai), where
                                        he built a large three-storey house. Rajagriha, which contained his personal
                                        library of over 50,000 books, then the largest private library in the world.
                                         In the same year, on 27 May 1935, his wife Ramabai died after a prolonged
                                        illness. Ramabai wanted to go to Pandharpur for pilgrimage before her death but
                                        Ambedkar did not allow her to do so. Ambedkar said that there is no point in
                                        going to the Hindu pilgrimage where they are considered untouchables, instead
                                        they talked about building a new Pandharpur for them.

                                        In 1936, Ambedkar founded the Independent Labor Party, which won 13 seats in the
                                        1937 Central Legislative Assembly elections. Ambedkar was elected as an MLA
                                        to the Bombay Legislative Assembly. He remained a member of the Legislative
                                        Assembly until 1942, during which time he also served as the Leader of the
                                        Opposition in the Bombay Legislative Assembly.

                                        In the same year, Ambedkar published his book 'Annihilation of Caste' on 15 May
                                        1936, which was based on a research paper written by him in New York. [60] In
                                        this book, Ambedkar criticized Hindu religious leaders and the caste system.
                                         He strongly criticized the decision of the Congress to refer to the
                                        untouchable community as Harijan, a term coined by Gandhi. Later, in a
                                        1955 BBC interview, he criticized Gandhi for his Gujarati language. Accused of

                                        Following the Lahore Resolution (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan,
                                        Ambedkar wrote a 400-page book called "Thoughts on Pakistan", which analyzed the
                                        concept of "Pakistan" in all its aspects. Criticized the demand for a separate
                                        country of Pakistan for Pakistan. Also argued that Hindus should accept the
                                        Pakistan of Muslims. He proposed that Punjab and Bengal be divided to separate
                                        Muslim and non-Muslim majority parts. Provincial boundaries should be redrawn.
                                        He thought that the Muslims could have no objection to the redrawing of
                                        provincial boundaries. If they did, they would not quite "understand the nature
                                        of their demand". Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan
                                        "precipitated Indian politics for a decade". It set the course of dialogue
                                        between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for
                                        the Partition of India.[69] However He was strongly critical of the divisive
                                        communal tactics of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, but argued that
                                        Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed as a single

                                        He cited historical events such as the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and
                                        Czechoslovakia in support of his idea of a communal divide between Hindus and
                                        Muslims. He asked whether there were sufficient reasons for the establishment of
                                        Pakistan? and suggested that it might have been possible to end the differences
                                        between Hindus and Muslims with a less drastic step. He has written that
                                        Pakistan should justify its existence. Communal issues have always been there
                                        even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and the French live
                                        together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together? He warned that the
                                        actual implementation of the two-nation solution would be extremely difficult.
                                        With the transfer of huge population, there will also be the problem of border
                                        dispute. This prediction was correct keeping in mind the violence that would
                                        happen after India's independence.

                                        Ambedkar saw his political party transform into the All India Scheduled Castes
                                        Federation, although it fared poorly in the 1946 elections to the Constituent
                                        Assembly of India. He was later elected to the Constituent Assembly from Bengal,
                                        where the Muslim League was in power. Ambedkar contested the first Indian
                                        Lok Sabha election of 1952 from Bombay North, but was defeated by his former
                                        assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Kajolkar. Ambedkar became a
                                        member of the Rajya Sabha in 1952. He tried to enter the Lok Sabha again in the
                                        1954 by-election from Bhandara, but he finished third (the Congress party won).
                                        By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had passed away.

                                        Ambedkar was twice a member of the Parliament of India representing Maharashtra
                                        in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India. His first term

                                        term was to be held from 3 April 1956 to 2 April 1962, but he died on 6 December

                                        On 30 September 1956, Ambedkar announced the establishment of the "Republican
                                        Party of India", rejecting the "Scheduled Caste Federation", but he died on 6
                                        December 1956, before the party could be formed. After that, his followers and
                                        workers planned to form this party. A meeting of the Presidency was held at
                                        Nagpur on 1 October 1957 to establish the party. N. Shivraj, Yashwant Ambedkar,

                                        meeting. The Republican Party of India was formed on 3 October 1957 and N.
                                        Shivraj was elected as the President of the party.

                                        Ambedkar in his book Who Were the Shudras? (Who were the Shudras?) explained the
                                        existence of the Shudras, the lowest caste in the hierarchy of the Hindu caste
                                        system. He also emphasized how the Atishudras (untouchables) were different
                                        from the Shudras. . Who Were the Shudras in 1948? In the sequel The
                                        Untouchables: A Thesis on the Origin of Untouchability, Ambedkar lambasted

                                        Hindu Civilization....which is a cruel device to enslave and suppress humanity
                                        and its proper name would be infamy. What else can be said about a civilization
                                        that has developed a vast mass of people who ... are considered inferior to a
                                        human and whose mere touch is reason enough to spread pollution?

                                        Ambedkar was also a great critic of the practices of Islam in South Asia. He
                                        took the side of the partition of India but strongly condemned the practice of
                                        child marriage prevalent among Muslims and the misbehavior with women. They
                                        said,

                                        Words cannot express the ill effects of polygamy and keeping concubines which
                                        are especially a source of sorrow for a Muslim woman. Take the caste system,
                                        everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, whereas slavery
                                        exists and is supported by Islam and Islamic countries. While the Prophet's
                                        prescriptions regarding justice and humane treatment of slaves contained in the
                                        Qur'an are praiseworthy, there is nothing in Islam that supports the abolition
                                        of this curse. Even if slavery is abolished, the caste system will remain among
                                        Muslims.

                                        He wrote that there are more social evils in Muslim society than in Hindu
                                        society and Muslims hide them by using soft words like "brotherhood". He also
                                        criticized the discrimination by Muslims against the Arzal classes who were
                                        considered "inferior" as well as the oppressive purdah system of oppression of
                                        women in Muslim society. they said that veil is also seen in Hindus but
                                        religious approval was given only by Muslims. He criticized the bigotry in
                                        Islam, due to which the society has become very bigotry due to the strict
                                        adherence to the rules of Islam and it has become very difficult to change it.
                                        He further wrote that Indian Muslims have failed to reform their society, while
                                        countries like Turkey, in contrast, have changed a lot.

                                        Suffering from "communalism", both groups of Hindus and Muslims have neglected
                                        the demand for social justice.
