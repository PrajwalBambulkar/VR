                                    <h1>A Voice for the Abolishment of Casteism: Towards an Equal and Inclusive Society</h1>
                                    <br>
                                    <h2 class="card-title">Introduction</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light firt-latter">Casteism remains a persistent and deeply rooted problem in societies, particularly in South Asia. The caste system's hierarchical nature perpetuates discrimination and inequality, impeding social advancement. This article highlights the significance of ending caste discrimination and establishing a society that treats everyone fairly and welcomes everyone, valuing their worth and freedoms regardless of their caste. By addressing these unjust actions, we can construct a society where people are not hindered by discrimination and can achieve success based on their skills and qualifications.</p> <br>

                                    <h2 class="card-title">Understanding Casteism:</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">Casteism is a deeply ingrained system of social discrimination that is prevalent in certain societies. It operates based on birth and hereditary hierarchies, dividing individuals into rigid social groups. This categorisation determines not only their occupation and social status but also their rights and opportunities in life. Sadly, discrimination and prejudice are deeply woven into the social fabric, perpetuating inequality, and restricting the prospects of those belonging to lower castes. <br> In some extreme cases, it even results in acts of violence and oppression against individuals from lower castes. Overcoming casteism requires concerted efforts to challenge and dismantle these discriminatory practices, promoting social justice and equal opportunities for all. </p> <br>
                                       
                                    
                                    <h2 class="card-title">The Call for Abolishment:</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">Eliminating casteism is vital for the establishment of a fair and egalitarian society. Caste-based discrimination directly contradicts the principles of social justice and human dignity, impeding societal progress and perpetuating long-standing inequalities between generations. To create a society that truly values the intrinsic worth and potential of every person, it is necessary to actively challenge and dismantle the systemic barriers that uphold casteism. <br> To create a society that values the intrinsic worth and potential of every person, it is essential to actively confront and dismantle the structural barriers that uphold casteism.</p> <br>

                                    <h2 class="card-title">Education and Awareness:</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">One of the most important roles played in removing the caste system is that of education. It serves as a powerful tool for raising awareness and fostering understanding about the unjust nature of the caste system. By prioritising inclusivity, educational institutions can contribute to breaking down prejudices and stereotypes associated with caste. It is important to incorporate an anti-caste curriculum that addresses the historical and contemporary issues surrounding caste-based discrimination. <br> Additionally, promoting social harmony and empathy through education enables individuals to develop critical thinking skills and challenge deeply ingrained casteist beliefs and practices.</p> <br>

                                    <h2 class="card-title">Legal Reforms and Enforcement:</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">Achieving the eradication of casteism necessitates the establishment of strong legal frameworks and their diligent enforcement. Legislation should unequivocally prohibit caste-based discrimination, guaranteeing equal rights and opportunities for every citizen. Robust laws need to be put in place to offer protection and support to individuals who endure caste-based atrocities. More effective law enforcement mechanisms must be done in order to make the output successful enough. <br> Additionally, creating accessible grievance redressal systems can provide a pathway to justice for victims of caste-based discrimination.    </p> <br>
 
                                    <h2 class="card-title">Economic Empowerment:</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">Addressing economic disparities is a key aspect of combating casteism. It is vital to promote economic opportunities and implement affirmative action programmes that specifically target marginalised communities. These measures can help break the cycle of poverty and marginalisation that lower caste individuals often find themselves in. <br> By encouraging entrepreneurship, providing skill development initiatives, and improving access to financial resources, we can empower individuals from lower castes to overcome the systemic barriers they face and actively participate in the economy. Creating a more inclusive and equitable economy is essential for fostering social mobility and dismantling the barriers that restrict the progress of marginalised communities.</p> <br>

                                    <h2 class="card-title">Promoting Social Integration:</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">Building a society that upholds social integration and equality necessitates the promotion of inter-caste marriages and the fostering of social interactions across caste boundaries. By dismantling the caste-based social barriers and facilitating meaningful interactions among people from different castes, we can weaken the foundations of casteism. Initiatives that encourage cultural exchanges, community-building activities, and social cohesion play a vital role in breaking down the divisions created by caste.  <br>Creating platforms for dialogue allows for the dismantling of stereotypes, the forging of connections between communities, and the cultivation of a shared sense of belonging. Through these endeavours, we can strive towards a future characterised by harmony, equity, and a celebration of unity amidst our differences.</p> <br>

                                    <h2 class="card-title">Empowering Marginalised Communities:</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">Empowering marginalised communities plays a pivotal role in dismantling casteism. It is essential to provide equitable access to quality education, healthcare, and social welfare schemes, bridging the gaps that hinder individuals from lower castes from realising their full potential. Empowerment programmes that focus on enhancing leadership skills, promoting political representation, and strengthening community networks can amplify the voices of marginalised communities  <br>By enabling active participation in decision-making processes, these initiatives ensure that the concerns and perspectives of lower-caste individuals are considered. Empowerment efforts go beyond providing opportunities; they foster a sense of agency and self-determination, enabling marginalised communities to challenge the systemic barriers imposed by casteism.</p> <br>

                                    <h2 class="card-title">Changing Mindsets and Challenging Privilege:</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">Overcoming casteism requires a profound transformation in societal attitudes, entailing a conscious and deliberate endeavour to challenge privilege. It is important to encourage individuals to unlearn casteist beliefs, critically examine their own privileges, and actively participate in conversations addressing caste discrimination. This collective effort fosters a culture of empathy, understanding, and equality. Media, literature, and art have a crucial role to play in challenging casteist narratives and promoting inclusive representations. <br> By diversifying narratives and uplifting marginalised voices, these creative mediums contribute to dismantling stereotypes and promoting social harmony. Additionally, promoting intergenerational dialogue and encouraging open discussions about caste discrimination can help break the cycle of inherited biases.</p> <br>

                                    <h2 class="card-title">Conclusion:</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">In conclusion, the eradication of casteism is imperative to forge a society rooted in justice and equality. It necessitates a holistic approach encompassing education, legal reforms, economic empowerment, social integration, and a shift in societal perspectives. Achieving this goal necessitates collective efforts, self-reflection, and genuine empathy to dismantle deeply ingrained caste-based hierarchies. Cultivating a culture of empathy and promoting equality will pave the way for a society where caste-based discrimination becomes a relic of the past.</p> <br>

                                        India. Along with Chandrashekhar Azad and other party members, he fought the
                                        powerful British government with unprecedented courage for India's independence.

                                        Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru, had killed British officer J.P. Saunders, who
                                        was Assistant Superintendent of Police in Lahore, on 17 December 1928.
                                        Revolutionary Chandrashekhar Azad had fully helped him in this action. Along
                                        with fellow revolutionary Batukeshwar Dutt, Bhagat Singh threw bombs and
                                        pamphlets on 8 April 1929 in the Parliament House, the auditorium of the then
                                        Central Assembly of British India, located in present-day New Delhi, to wake up
                                        the British government. After throwing the bomb, both of them also gave their
                                        arrest there.

                                    <p class="font-light">At that time Bhagat Singh was about twelve years old when the
                                        Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place. As soon as he got information about this,
                                        Bhagat Singh reached Jallianwala Bagh by walking 12 miles from his school. At
                                        this age, Bhagat Singh used to read the revolutionary books of his uncles and
                                        wonder whether his path was right or not? After Gandhiji's non-cooperation
                                        movement started, he started choosing a path for himself between Gandhiji's
                                        non-violent methods and the violent movement of the revolutionaries.

                                        Due to the cancellation of Gandhi ji's non-cooperation movement, some anger
                                        arose in him, but like the whole nation, he also respected Mahatma Gandhi. But
                                        instead of Gandhiji's non-violent movement, he did not consider it inappropriate
                                        to adopt the path of violent revolution for the freedom of the country. He
                                        started participating in processions and became a member of many revolutionary
                                        parties. The main revolutionaries of his party were Chandrashekhar Azad,
                                        Sukhdev, Rajguru etc. In the Kakori incident, Bhagat Singh was so disturbed by
                                        the death sentences of 4 revolutionaries and imprisonment of 16 others that he
                                        merged his party Naujawan Bharat Sabha with Hindustan Republican Association in
                                        1928 and gave it a new name Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. 10]

                                        In 1928 there were fierce demonstrations to boycott the Simon Commission. The
                                        British government also lathi-charged the participants in these demonstrations.
                                        Lala Lajpat Rai died after being hurt by this lathi charge. Couldn't live with
                                        them anymore. Under a secret plan, he thought of a plan to kill Police
                                        Superintendent Scott. According to the thought plan, Bhagat Singh and Rajguru
                                        started walking in front of Lahore Kotwali in a busy posture. On the other hand,
                                        Jaigopal sat down with his bicycle as if it had broken down. Both became alert
                                        on Gopal's signal. On the other hand, Chandrashekhar Azad was working as a guard
                                        in carrying out the incident by hiding near the boundary wall of the nearby
                                        D.A.L.V. school.

                                        Saunders arrived, Rajguru fired a bullet directly into his head, which would
                                        have killed him earlier. But soon after, Bhagat Singh also made complete
                                        arrangements for his death by firing 3-4 bullets. As soon as these two were
                                        running away, a constable Chanan Singh started chasing them. Chandrashekhar Azad
                                        warned him - "If he moves forward, I will shoot him." On not agreeing, Azad shot
                                        him and he died on the spot. In this way these people took revenge for the death

                                    <p class="font-light">Although Bhagat Singh was not in favor of bloodshed, but he
                                        believed in leftist ideology, and he was related to the principles of Karl Marx
                                        and he was promoting the same ideology. However, he was also a staunch supporter
                                        of socialism. In the past, his opponents have been accusing him of tricking the
                                        youth in the name of Bhagat Singh by telling him their ideology. Despite the
                                        Congress being in power, the Congress could not get Bhagat Singh the status of a
                                        martyr, because they only used Bhagat Singh's name to connect the youth to their
                                        party. He did not like the capitalists' policy of exploitation towards the
                                        workers. At that time, since the British were the surveyors and very few Indian
                                        industrialists were able to progress, it was natural for them to protest against
                                        the atrocities of the British towards the labourers. It was their group's
                                        decision not to let the anti-labour policies be passed in the British
                                        Parliament. Everyone wanted that the British should know that Indians have woken
                                        up and there is anger in their hearts towards such policies. To do this, he had
                                        planned to throw a bomb in the Central Assembly of Delhi.

                                        Bhagat Singh wanted it to not have any bloodshed and that his 'voice' could also
                                        reach the British. Although in the beginning all the people of his party did not
                                        think so, but in the end the names of Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt were
                                        unanimously chosen. According to the schedule, on 8 April 1929, both of them
                                        threw a bomb in the Central Assembly at a place where no one was present,
                                        otherwise they could get hurt. The whole hall was filled with smoke.

                                        Bhagat Singh could have run away if he wanted, but he had already thought that
                                        he would accept the punishment, even if it was hanging; So he refused to run. At
                                        that time both of them were wearing khaki shirt and shorts. After the bomb
                                        exploded, they chanted "Inquilab-zindabad, imperialism-murdabad!" [11] raised
                                        slogans and threw the pamphlets they had brought with them in the air. Shortly
                                        thereafter the police arrived and both were arrested.

                                        Bhagat Singh remained in jail for almost 2 years. During this, he used to
                                        express his revolutionary thoughts by writing articles. His studies continued
                                        continuously even while in jail. His articles and letters written during that
                                        time to his relatives are still the mirror of his thoughts. In his writings, he
                                        has described capitalists as his enemies in many ways. He wrote that the person
                                        who exploits the laborers, even if he is an Indian, is their enemy. He also
                                        wrote an article in English in jail titled Why am I an atheist? In
                                        jail, Bhagat Singh and his companions went on a hunger strike for 64 days. One
                                        of his companions, Yatindranath Das, had sacrificed his life in hunger strike.

                                        On August 26, 1930, the court convicted Bhagat Singh under sections 129, 302 of
                                        the Indian Penal Code and sections 4 and 6F of the Explosive Substances Act and
                                        section 120 of the IPC. On October 7, 1930, the court gave a 68-page verdict, in
                                        which Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were sentenced to death. Section 144 was
                                        imposed in Lahore as soon as the death sentence was pronounced. After this, an
                                        appeal was filed in the Privy Council for pardon of Bhagat Singh's death
                                        sentence, but this appeal was rejected on January 10, 1931. After this, the then
                                        Congress President Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya filed an appeal before the Viceroy
                                        for pardon on February 14, 1931, that using his privilege, he should waive the
                                        death sentence on the basis of humanity. Mahatma Gandhi spoke to the Viceroy on
                                        February 17, 1931, to pardon Bhagat Singh's death sentence, and then on February
                                        18, 1931, on behalf of the general public, also filed an appeal with various
                                        arguments in front of the Viceroy for pardon. All this was happening against the
                                        wishes of Bhagat Singh because Bhagat Singh did not want his sentence to be
                                        forgiven.

                                        Bhagat Singh and his two companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged on March 23,
                                        1931 at around 7.33 pm. Before going to the gallows, he was reading Lenin's
                                        biography and when he was asked his last wish So he said that he was reading
                                        Lenin's biography and that he should be given time to complete it. When the
                                        prison authorities informed him that the time had come for his execution, he is
                                        said to have said- "Wait! First one revolutionary should meet the other." Then
                                        after a minute, the book bounced towards the ceiling and said - "Okay now let's
                                        go."
                                    <p class="font-light">
                                        While going to the gallows, all three of them were singing merrily -
                                        <br>
                                        <li> me color Basanti Chola, give me color.</li>

                                        Fearing that no movement might break out after the hanging, the British first
                                        cut his dead body into pieces, then filled it in sacks and took it to Ferozepur,
                                        where instead of ghee, kerosene was burnt. When the people of the village saw
                                        the fire burning, they came closer. Fearing this, the British threw the
                                        half-burnt pieces of his dead body into the Sutlej river and ran away. When the
                                        villagers came near, they collected the pieces of his dead body and duly
                                        cremated it. And Bhagat Singh became immortal forever. After this, people
                                        started considering Gandhi as responsible for his death along with the British.
                                        For this reason, when Gandhi was going to attend the Lahore session of Congress,

                                        (Punjabi's Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi and Hindi and Arabic and Urdu in particular),
                                        caste and religion in Indian society. He also considered the attack of an Indian
                                        on the weaker section of the society with the same strictness as the atrocities
                                        done by an Englishman.

                                    Apart from Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and English, Bhagat Singh also knew Bangla which he
                                    learned from Batukeshwar Dutt. He believed that his martyrdom would further disturb
                                    the Indian public and this could hardly happen if he remained alive. For this
                                    reason, he flatly refused to write an apology even after being sentenced to death.
                                    Bhagat Singh followed the guidelines given by Pandit Ram Prasad 'Bismil' in his
                                    autobiography . He also wrote a letter to the British government, in which it
                                    was said that he should be considered a prisoner of war symbolizing the war of
                                    Indians against the British government and instead of being hanged, he should be
                                    shot. Before his execution, on March 3, his brother Bhagat Singh wrote in a
                                    letter sent to Kultar. How can today's youth become Bhagat Singh? Newsgram Archived

                                        His bravery can be estimated from these passionate lines. At the time of his
                                        first meeting with Chandrashekhar Azad, he took a vow by placing his hand on a

                                        papers in India in those days, Indian intellectuals did not know about it. His
