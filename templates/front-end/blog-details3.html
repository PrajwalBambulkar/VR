                                    <br>

                                    <p class="font-light firt-latter">Mahatma Jotirao Govindrao Phule (11 April 1827 –
                                        28 November 1890) was an Indian social reformer, social enlightener, thinker,
                                        social worker, writer, philosopher and revolutionary activist. He is also known
                                        as Mahatma Phule and "Jotiba Phule". In September 1873, he formed an
                                        organization named Satya Shodhak Samaj in Maharashtra. He did many works for the
                                        upliftment of women and backward and untouchables. He was a strong advocate of
                                        providing education to all sections of the society. He was against caste-based
                                        division and discrimination prevailing in the Indian society.
                                    </p><br>

                                    <p class="font-light">
                                        Their basic objective has been to provide the right to education to women,
                                        oppose child marriage, support widow marriage. Phule wanted to free the society
                                        from the evil practice, the trap of superstition. She spent her whole life in
                                        providing education to women, in making women aware of their rights. In the 19th
                                        century, women were not given education. Phule wanted to save women from gender
                                        discrimination. He built India's first school for girls in Pune. Phule was
                                        very disturbed and saddened by the pathetic condition of women at that time,
                                        that is why he firmly decided that he would continue to bring revolutionary
                                        changes in the society. He himself provided education to his wife Savitribai
                                        Phule. Savitribai Phule was the first female teacher of India.

                                    <p class="font-light">A statue of Jyotiba Phule located in Karad
                                        Mahatma Jyotiba Phule was born in Pune in 1827 AD. His mother passed away when
                                        he was only one year old. He was brought up by a woman. His family came to Pune
                                        from Satara many generations ago and started making Gajras of flowers etc.
                                        That's why these people engaged in the work of gardener were known as 'Phule'.
                                        Jyotiba studied in Marathi till some time ago, dropped out and later at the age
                                        of 21 completed her seventh grade studies in English. He was married in 1840 to
                                        Savitri Bai, who later became a famous social worker herself. Both husband and
                                        wife worked together in the field of Dalit and women's education. He was a hard
                                        worker and a social worker.

                                    <h2 class="card-title">2. Workspace :</h2>
                                    <p class="font-light">He did a lot of work for the welfare of widows and women,
                                        along with this he also made a lot of efforts to improve the condition of
                                        farmers and their welfare. Phule opened a school in 1848 to improve the
                                        condition of women and for their education. It was the first school in the
                                        country for this work. He could not find a teacher to teach the girls, so he
                                        himself made his wife Savitri Phule eligible by doing this work for a few days.
                                        Some people tried to obstruct his work from the beginning, but when Phule kept
                                        moving forward, he put pressure on his father and got the husband and wife out
                                        of the house, because of this his work stopped for some time, but soon he Opened
                                        three schools for girls one after the other.

                                    <p class="font-light">Jyotiba had a great interest in reading the biographies of
                                        saints. He came to know that when all men and women are equal in front of God
                                        then why should there be any difference between high and low. Jyotiba opened a
                                        school in 1848 to improve the condition of women and for their education. It was
                                        the first school in the country for this work. If a teacher could not be found
                                        to teach the girls, he did this work himself for a few days and made his wife
                                        Savitri eligible.

                                        Some people tried to obstruct his work from the beginning, but when Phule kept

                                        <br>
                                        Jyotiba established 'Satyashodhak Samaj' in 1873 to provide justice to the poor
                                        and weak. Seeing his social service, in 1888 he was given the title of 'Mahatma'
                                        in a huge meeting in Mumbai. Jyotiba started the marriage rituals without the
                                        Brahmin-priest and it was also recognized by the Bombay High Court. He was
                                        against child marriage and was a supporter of widow remarriage. During his
                                        lifetime, he also wrote many books – Gulamgiri, Tritiya Ratna, Chhatrapati

                                        the struggle of Mahatma Jyotiba and his organization, the government passed the
                                        'Agriculture Act'. He also wrote many books to bring out the truth of religion,
                                        society and traditions.

                                        Title by the British Government: In 1883, for the great work of providing
                                        education to women, she was honored by the then British Government of India as
                                        "the father of women's education".
